# Indian Food Detection with Deep Learning

The project aims to utilize deep learning techniques for computer vision to detect and classify various Indian food items in images. With a dataset of 4000 images spanning 80 different categories, the goal is to create a model that can accurately identify and categorize the diverse range of Indian cuisines based on locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
